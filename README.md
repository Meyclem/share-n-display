## User Documentation

For now there is no user documentation. The project is still under heavy development (and that's an understatement ðŸ˜‰).

## Developer Documentation

You can find the developer documentation in the [related section](/docs/developer-documentation.md).

See the [Public roadmap](https://github.com/users/Meyclem/projects/3) on GitHub.

## Inspiration

The project is inspired by [Alan Grainger](https://github.com/alangrainger)'s [Obsidian Share Note plugin](https://obsidian.md/publish) and the will to have a self-hosted solution.
